## Technical Architecture and Stack Justification

The architecture of CollabHub is grounded in high-performance, scalable technologies carefully selected to meet the demands of real-time applications and enterprise-grade software engineering.

* **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** (leveraging React) for server-side rendering and rapid, scalable UI development. **Tailwind CSS** ensures a highly responsive, component-driven interface with minimal CSS overhead. **TypeScript** is employed throughout the frontend to enforce static typing, enhancing developer productivity and codebase maintainability.

* **Backend**: Powered by **FastAPI** (Python), chosen for its asynchronous capabilities and superior performance in API response times. The backend supports RESTful APIs and real-time WebSocket connections, ensuring both traditional request/response cycles and persistent live communication.

* **Real-Time Engine**: WebSocket-based bi-directional communication layer facilitates instantaneous code sync and task updates across multiple clients with zero-lag user experience.

* **Database Layer**: **PostgreSQL** is the database of choice for its robustness, relational capabilities, and ability to handle transactional workloads at scale. **Prisma ORM** abstracts database interactions, offering type-safe query building and schema migrations that align with modern development workflows.

* **Containerization & Deployment**: All services are containerized using **Docker**, enabling consistency across environments and streamlined CI/CD pipelines. The frontend will be deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring global CDN distribution and instant rollbacks. The backend will be hosted via **Render** or **Railway**, chosen for their scalability and seamless integration with CI/CD workflows.

* **Security & Compliance**: Security is woven into every layer, with end-to-end encryption protocols, secure token-based authentication, and SSO support. Role-based access control ensures fine-grained permissions management for users and teams.

This curated stack ensures that CollabHub is not just a collaborative tool, but a resilient, production-ready platform that meets the real-world needs of modern engineering teams.
